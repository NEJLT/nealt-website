The **Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)** addresses all
aspects of computational linguistics, natural language processing, speech
recognition and synthesis, including language resources, as well as work in
closely related neighbouring disciplines (such as, for example, linguistics or
psychology) that is sufficiently formalized or applied to bear relevance to
speech and language technologies.

The proceedings are published as part of the [NEALT Proceedings
Series](/proceedings) by [LiU Electronic
Press](https://ep.liu.se/en/conferences.aspx) and are also hosted by the [ACL
Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/venues/nodalida/).
