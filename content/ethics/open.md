NoDaLiDa proceedings are full open access. This means that accepted papers may be downloaded directly from the web and will not be charged for. There are also no fees for submitting or for publishing. There are no plans to collect fees at any point in the future from any part of the NEALT process.

Papers published in NoDaLiDa proceedings will also appear on the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/venues/nodalida/), which is a fully open access library with direct PDF download, managed by ACL volunteers.
